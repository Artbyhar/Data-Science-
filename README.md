## Installation

Build **Data-Science-** from the source and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aribybar/Data-Science-.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Data-Science-
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - **Windows**:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **Mac/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install core dependencies manually:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter seaborn
